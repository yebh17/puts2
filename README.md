# Base plate for lab 2

<!-- A simple flask(micro web framework) based online calculator.

The idea is to create a simple online calculator.The features are implemented in the following sequence.

addition
subtraction
multiplication
division

As the solution is flask-based, it will be accessed via a http interface.

The solution also satisfies the following requirements:
1. The final solution handles any Rational Number and also implemented those in stages, i.e. first Integers, and then Rational Numbers.
2. This online calculator project is forked from "https://github.com/patrikarlos/puts2" and followed the indicated api in that git repo.
3. Each feature was implemented as a branch, and once tested merged in to master together with the tests used to test the feature.  


steps to run this flask based online calculator:
1. clone the repository, "git clone https://github.com/yebh17/puts2.git"
2. The python script was developed in version 3.7, so For running the main script type "python3 main.py"
3. Go to the web browser and produce the below links for their respective sequences outputs.
    I. For addition "http://127.0.0.1:5000/add?A=value1&B=value2"
    II. For substraction "http://127.0.0.1:5000/sub?A=value1&B=value2"
    III. For multiplication "http://127.0.0.1:5000/mul?A=value1&B=value2" 
    IV. For division "http://127.0.0.1:5000/div?A=value1&B=value2"
4. For running the tests script type "python3 test_main.py" -->
